Base project for lab assignment 1

3.) The page seems to be structured from the top down with the 
loading of the page above all that. The html tag seams to
open and load all the components of the page. This page 
seems to have 2 basic parts on the structure: the head and
the body. In this case, the head only seems to serve for structure 
purposes, since everything web design is done in the body part.
The tag meta doesnÂ´t seem to do anything on the page itself
but probably has something to do with metadataon the 
web browser. The link tag probably bonds the content on the
page with the web. Finally, the title tag seems to give the website
its name. As to the body part of the website, all of the design
and architecture is done here. The structure goes from top
to bottom starting by the header, then going to the information
and ending on the footer. The tag center probably gives the
page the margins requested and the table tag creates a field
of work with its corresponding margins, fonts and colors.
The tbody tag seems to design all the information inside the
table created by using the tr and td tags which give the table
their inner fonts, colors and dimensions. Finally, a and b tags
seem to create links between certain elements and others within
the same page or with other web pages. Finally, there is the span
tag but I am not quite sure of what it does. 

4.) In the sources tab, 6 documents are listed. The first three
are file documents and the last 3 are gifs or icons used on the
wabpage. The first document is called index and is filled
with html tags such as head, html, link, title, tr, a, etc. This
means that this document is the source of all the structural
design of the webpage. Everything mentioned on part 3 comes from here.
The next file is called hn.js, which seems to be coding. I suppose .js is 
javascript. This is the document that probably creates the interactions
within the webpage with other tabs and pages. The last document is called
news.css, which is a css file. This file seems to be more specific
design (both sthetics and structure), since it considers
aspects that the first document doesnt such as font size and font 
design among others.
